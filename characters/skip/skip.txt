Skip is a good-natured person who believes in right/wrong, but not the law/courts' final say on that matter. Doesn't believe in deception per se. He'll do what he thinks is the right thing and naively believes everyone else will see it the same way. He acts in good faith most of the time. Is not about thieving or putting thumb on the scale when he can; but not upset when he catches others doing it either, views it as all part of a game. [Lupin, Jesper, Solo]

Quirks: 
- big on agriculture, tends a garden. But sucks at it. (no nature or survival prof). Only thing he gets worked up about. Did learn some folk remedy (medicine) from it
- history nerd and loves to talk about it
