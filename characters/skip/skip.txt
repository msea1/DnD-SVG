Skip is a good-natured person who believes in right/wrong, but not the law/courts' final say on that matter. Doesn't believe in deception per se. He'll do what he thinks is the right thing and naively believes everyone else will see it the same way. He acts in good faith most of the time. Is not about thieving or putting thumb on the scale when he can; but not upset when he catches others doing it either, views it as all part of a game. [Lupin, Jesper, Solo]

Quirks: 
- big on agriculture, tends a garden. But sucks at it. (no nature or survival prof). Only thing he gets worked up about. Did learn some folk remedy (medicine) from it
- history nerd and loves to talk about it

Message
Level: 0
Casting Time: 1 Action
Range: 120 feet
Duration: 1 round
Components: V, S, M (a short piece of copper wire)
Save:
Damage Type:

You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear. You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn’t have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.


Minor Illusion
Level: 0
Casting Time: 1 Action
Range: 30 feet
Duration: 1 minute
Components: S, M (a bit of fleece)
Save: intelligence
Damage Type:

You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again. If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends. If you create an image of an object such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can’t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.


Vicious Mockery
Level: 0
Casting Time: 1 Action
Range: 60 feet
Duration: Instantaneous
Components: V
Save: wisdom
Damage Type: psychic

You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you (thought it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

At Higher Levels
This spell’s damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).


Dissonant Whispers
Level: 1
Casting Time: 1 Action
Range: 60 feet
Duration: Instantaneous
Components: V
Save: wisdom

You whisper a discordant melody that only one creature of your choice within range can hear, wracking it with terrible pain. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction , if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from you. The creature doesn’t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn’t have to move away. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save.

At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st


Faerie Fire
Level: 1
Casting Time: 1 Action
Range: 60 feet
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Components: V
Save: dexterity
Damage Type:

Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Any creature in the area when the spell is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius. Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can’t benefit from being invisible.

Components: V, S, M (a pinch of fine sand rose petals, or a cricket)
Save:
Damage Type:

This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll 5d8, the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures). Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature’s hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature’s hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected. Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren’t affected by this spell.

At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d8 for each slot level above 1st.
