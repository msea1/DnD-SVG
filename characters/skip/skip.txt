Skip is a good-natured person who believes in right/wrong, but not the law/courts' final say on that matter. Doesn't believe in deception per se. He'll do what he thinks is the right thing and naively believes everyone else will see it the same way. He acts in good faith most of the time.

Quirks: big on agriculture, tends a garden. But sucks at it.
